Python project that returns expected yearly carbon emissions given gas type, miles driven per day, monthly electricity usage, and yearly miles flown on planes.


Uses a Monte Carlo Simulation for prediction of CO2 emission and displays data on two excel sheets:

Simulated Excel Sheet:
-Displays data from n number of iterations (n is given as a user input) on Excel sheet along with a histogram. As iterations go up, the histogram looks closer to a bell curve

Summarized Excel Sheet:
-Displays avg value of CO2 emissions from each category in table and pie chart form, and is appropriately labeled

numpy, panda, openpxyl, and mathplotlib were utilized for this project

Example pie chart png, histogram png, and excel sheet are given, but users can download the program and input their own values
